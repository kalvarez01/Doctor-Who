      <h1>Abzorbaloff</h1>
      <p>The Abzorbaloff is a monster designed by nine-year-old William Grantham of Colchester, Essex for a &quot;Design a Doctor Who Monster&quot; competition held by Blue Peter.[3] The competition was announced in July 2005, and received 43,920 entries. These were judged by Blue Peter editor Richard Marson, presenter Gethin Jones, Doctor Who producer Russell T Davies and Tenth Doctor David Tennant. The first prize for the competition was to have the monster appear in an episode of Doctor Who. Tennant announced the winner on Blue Peter on 17 August 2005. </p>
      <p>Conditions of the competition meant that the monster had to be able to be made from prosthetics and not require CGI. Russell T Davies revealed on the Doctor Who Confidential episode &quot;New World of Who&quot; that Grantham imagined the Abzorbaloff to be the size of a double-decker bus, so was initially disappointed to see the final size of his creation. However, Grantham's design had not included size specifications (though the remains of the monster's victims on and within his body hinted at his being huge) and a larger size would not have fit the criteria of the competition unless the monster were superimposed on footage later on a larger scale. Ultimately, CGI was used for some shots of the talking faces on the Abzorbaloff.</p>
